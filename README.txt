== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my RSS feed not showing any images or is served with the incorrect image size? =

The image is not available in the correct size. In most cases, this is solved by simply regenerating the thumbnails. Try another image size or regenerate them. For regenerating the different image sizes we recommend the plugin <a targe="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a>.

= Why is my RSS feed showing/not showing after I disabled/enabled it? =

After activating or deactivating the default feed or your custom feed it is necessary to flush the permalinks. Just go to the permalinks settings page and save it without changing anything.

If you get a fatal error while activating RSS Chimp Pro it is mostly because RSS Chimp Free is still activated. Please deactivate the free version of the plugin and try to activate RSS Chimp Pro again. Now everything should work as expected.
